# 2048 Game in Python with Pygame

This repository contains a Python implementation of the popular game "2048" using the Pygame library. The game features a grid of tiles that players combine by moving in four directions to achieve higher scores, aiming to create a tile with the number 2048.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. Python can be installed from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and Pygame can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/2048-Game-in-Python.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd 2048-Game-in-Python
```

## Running the Game

To run the game, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move the tiles:
  - **Left Arrow Key (`←`)**: Move tiles left.
  - **Right Arrow Key (`→`)**: Move tiles right.
  - **Up Arrow Key (`↑`)**: Move tiles up.
  - **Down Arrow Key (`↓`)**: Move tiles down.

Combine tiles with the same numbers to form a tile with their sum. The goal is to reach a tile numbered 2048.

## Game Features

- **Simple GUI**: Utilizes Pygame to create an easy-to-use graphical user interface.
- **Persistent State**: Game state is continuously updated in response to player moves.
- **Color-Coded Tiles**: Tiles change color as their values increase.

## Customization

You can adjust the game settings such as grid size and speed by modifying the constants at the beginning of the script:

- `FPS`: Frames per second.
- `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`: Dimensions of the game window.
- `ROWS`, `COLS`: Number of rows and columns in the grid.

Feel free to fork this project and tailor it to your preferences.
